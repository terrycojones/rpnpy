# rpn.py - a reverse-Polish notation calculator for Python

Here is `rpn.py`, a script implementing a
[reverse-Polish notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation)
(RPN) calculator for Python.

As well as providing for traditional numeric calculator operations, it
provides easy access to many Python functions, and you can put Python
objects and functions onto the stack and operate on them.

I wrote this for 3 reasons:

1.  I absolutely loved the [HP-41C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HP-41C)
    programmable calculator series, which used RPN. Although I had taught
    myself to program on a
    [Casio FX-502P](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casio_FX-502P_series) in
    1978, the Casio was like a toy compared to the HP-41C. I owned a 41C, a
    41CV, and then a 41CX, had a bunch of memory expansion packs, several
    other add-on packs (e.g., stats), a card reader/writer, and got it
    overclocked by some hardware hacker friends. It was an amazing machine.
    I still have one.
1.  I have been using the [UNIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix)
    [dc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dc_(computer_program)) (desk
    calculator) command on almost a daily basis since 1983. `dc` is ancient
    (in UNIX terms), predating even
    [the C programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C_(programming_language)). It
    provides a minimalist RPN calculator. You can even program it, if you
    have a taste for mystery. Here's a program I wrote in 1984 to factor
    numbers:

        [[neither]plsx]sn[c2pla2/sallx]se[ladv1+sm0=nla1=ncla2=pla2%0=elfx]sl
        [ldlm<pclald%0=cld2+sdlfx]sf[lap[is prime.]plsx]sp[ldplald/salfx]sc
        [[enter X : ]P?dsa0>n3sdllx]ss[[negative]plsx]snlsx

    [That code](https://gist.github.com/terrycojones/bdc16bf8910ba16dd2dd6ccab8cd7e53)
    still runs today, 35 years later, totally unchanged.  But `dc` has only
    a tiny set of operations. So while it's great to be able to easily use
    it from the command line (e.g., `echo 4 5 + p | dc`), I frequently find
    myself reaching for a real calculator or launch an interactive session
    with a full programming language (Perl, Python, etc), which feels a bit
    heavyweight and requires more syntax.
1. I was curious what it would be like to have a Python RPN calculator that
   offered both the minimalist syntax of `dc` but that also offered a much
   wider range of operations and made it possible to put Python objects
   (lists, dicts, functions, etc.) onto the stack and operate on them. I'm
   curious what use I'll make of it, and what others might do with it too.

*Note* that this is a work in progress! Everything may change. Suggestions
very welcome.

## Example rpn.py sessions

Before getting a bit more formal (and boring) in describing how you use
`rpn.py`, here are some example sessions to give you a flavor.

(BTW, I set my shell up to alias `pc` (Python calculator) for `rpn.py` to
minimize typing and be a bit more like `dc`. But I'll use `rpn.py` in the
examples below.)

```sh
# Add two numbers. The stack is printed after all commands are run.
$ rpn.py 4 5 +
9

# Do the same thing, but read from standard input (all the commands below
# could also be run in this way).
$ echo 4 5 + | rpn.py
9

# Sine of 90 degrees (note that Python's sin function operates on
# radians). The commands are in quotes so the shell doesn't expand the '*'.
$ rpn.py '90 pi 180 / * sin'
1.0

# Same thing, different quoting.
$ rpn.py 90 pi 180 / \* sin
1.0

# Same thing, use 'mul' instead of '*'.
$ rpn.py 90 pi 180 / mul sin
1.0

# Area of a circle radius 10
$ rpn.py 'pi 10 10 * *'
314.1592653589793

# Equivalently, using ':2' to push 10 onto the stack twice.
$ rpn.py 'pi 10:2 * *'
314.1592653589793

# Equivalently, using 'dup' to duplicate the 10 and 'mul' instead of '*'
$ rpn.py pi 10 dup mul mul
314.1592653589793
```

### Function calling argument push order

On a regular RPN calculator you would do what we normally think of as an
[infix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infix_notation) operation such as
`5 - 4` by pushing `5` onto the stack, then pushing `4`, and finally
running the `-` function. The operator is taken out of middle and given at
the end and the original infix order of the arguments is the order you push
them onto the stack. Of course this doesn't make any difference for
commutative operations like `+` and `*`, but is important for `/` and `-`.

In Python we have various functions like
[`map`](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/functions.html#map),
[`filter`](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/functions.html#filter),
[`functools.reduce`](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/functools.html#functools.reduce),
and the long-ago deprecated Python 2
[`apply`](https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#apply) function.
These are typically thought of as having a prefix or
[Polish notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polish_notation) signature,
accepting a function followed by an iterable. E.g.,
[`map(function, iterable)`](https://docs.python.org/3.5/library/functions.html#map).

To be consistent, with RPN argument pushing just described for the numeric
operations, in the case of (what we normally think of as) prefix functions
such as `map`, we should therefore push the function to be run, then push
the iterable, then call `map` (`reduce`, `filter`, etc).

Like this:

```sh
$ rpn.py [6,7,8] 'str:! map:i'
['6', '7', '8']
```

Here the `:!` modifier causes the `str` function to be pushed onto the
stack instead of being run, and the `:i` modifier causes the result of
`map` to be iterated before being added to the stack.


Continuing on the map theme, if you for some reason had the elements on the
stack in the wrong order, you could reverse part of the stack before
running a function:

```sh
$ rpn.py 'str:! [6,7,8] reverse map:i'
['6', '7', '8']
```

The `reverse` command operates on two stack items by default, but it can
take a numeric argument or you can run it with the `:*` modifier which will
cause it to be run on the whole stack:

```sh
# Reverse the top 3 stack elements then reverse the whole of the stack.
$ rpn.py '5 6 7 8 reverse:3 reverse:*'
[6, 7, 8, 5]
```

### More examples

```sh
# The area of a circle again, but using reduce to do the multiplying.  The
# ':!' modifier tells rpn.py to push the '*' function onto the stack
# instead of immediately running it.
$ rpn.py '*:! [pi,10,10] reduce'
314.1592653589793

# Same thing, but push the numbers individually onto the stack, then the
# ':3' tells reduce to use three stack items. Use 'mul' as an
# alternative to '*'.
$ rpn.py 'mul:! pi 10 dup reduce:3'
314.1592653589793

# Equivalently, using ':*' to tell reduce to use the whole stack.
$ rpn.py '*:! pi 10 dup reduce:*'
314.1592653589793

# If you don't want to push the function for 'reduce' to use onto the stack
# first, use ':r' to tell it to use the top of the stack:
$ rpn.py 'pi 10 dup mul:! reduce:3r'
314.1592653589793

# Push 'True' onto the stack 5 times, turn the whole stack ('*') into a
# list and print it ('p'), then pass that list to 'sum'.
$ rpn.py 'True:5 list:*p sum'
[True, True, True, True, True]
5

# Here's something a bit more long-winded (and totally pointless):
#
# Push 0..9 onto the stack (iterating the result of 'range'.
# call Python's 'reversed' function
# push the 'str' function
# use 'map' to convert the list of digits to strings
# join the string digits with the empty string
# convert the result to an int
# take the square root
# push 3 onto the stack
# call 'round' to round the result to three decimal places
#
# the ':i' modifier (used here twice) causes the value from the command
# to be iterated and the result to be put on the stack as a single list.
# It's a convenient way to iterate over a generator, a range, a map,
# dictionary keys, etc.

$ rpn.py 'range(10):i reversed str:! map:ir "" join:r int sqrt 3 round:2'
99380.799
```

The `:2` on the `round` call tells it to use two arguments from the stack
(`round` uses one by default in `rpn.py`).

The `:r` on the `map` call makes it look for the function to run on the top
of the stack, rather than searching up the stack to find it. If you think
further in advance, you can push the function first:

```sh
$ rpn.py 'str:! range(10):i reversed map:i "" join:r int sqrt 3 round:2'
99380.799
```

The same goes for the string used by `join`: it could have been pushed
first, and then there would be no need for the `:r` on the `join`:

```sh
$ rpn.py '"" str:! range(10):i reversed map:i join int sqrt 3 round:2'
99380.799
```

You could (of course!) do this last example in Python with a bunch of
parens:

```python
from math import sqrt
print(round(sqrt(int(''.join(map(str, reversed(range(10)))))), 3))
```

The elimination of parens is the main beauty of RPN (at least
aesthetically - the stack model of computation is a pretty awesome idea
too).  The price is that you have to learn to think in postfix. With the
`:r` modifier, `rpn.py` tries to be flexible in where it will find things
on the stack.  There's also the `swap` command in case you forget to push
something and need to flip the top stack items before running some other
command.

It might be convenient to do more involved calculations in an interactive
REPL session:

```sh
# REPL usage, with automatic splitting of whitespace turned off
# (so we give one command per line).
$ rpn.py --noSplit
--> 4
--> 5
--> 6
--> stack
[4, 5, 6]
--> f  # f is an alias for 'stack', as in dc.
[4, 5, 6]
--> clear  # Or just 'c'
--> f
[]
--> from numpy import log2
--> 32
--> log2
--> p
5.0
--> {'a':6, 'b':10, 'c':15}
--> len
--> p
3
--> [6,7,8]
--> str :!
--> f
[[6, 7, 8], <class 'str'>]
--> swap
--> f
[<class 'str'>, [6, 7, 8]]
--> map :i
--> f
['6', '7', '8']
```

```sh
$ rpn.py --noSplit
--> def celcius(f): return (f - 32) / 1.8  # Nothing is added to the stack here.
--> 212
--> celcius :p  # Use :p to print the result immediately
100.0

$ rpn.py --noSplit
--> lambda f: (f - 32) / 1.8
--> 212
--> apply :p
100.0

# Same as above, but push the anonymous function last.
$ rpn.py --noSplit
--> 212
--> lambda f: (f - 32) / 1.8
--> apply :pr
100.0
```

## Usage

The calculator either works interactively from the shell using a
[read-eval-print loop](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop)
(REPL) or will read commands either from the command line or from standard
input. If you specify file names (including using `-` to indicate standard
input), commands will be read from the file(s).  Run `rpn.py --help` to see
command line options.

### Command syntax

Input lines are either comments (first non-whitespace character on the line
is `#`) or specify a command (or commands) followed by optional modifiers.

If given, modifiers must follow a `:`.  The modifiers are a set of single
letters and may also include a single number. The input `+ :p= 17` causes
the `+` command to be executed, with modifiers `p`, `=`, and `17`.  The
full list of commands and modifiers is given below.

If modifiers are given, they apply to all commands on an input line.

#### Input line splitting

By default, `rpn.py` will split lines on whitespace and each field will be
taken as a command. Hence:

```sh
$ rpn.py 4 5 +
9
```

will push `4` and then `5` onto the stack and then replace those two values
by their sum.

In REPL mode, `rpn.py` prints `--> ` as a prompt (see the <a
href="#repl">REPL section</a> below).

In many cases it is easy to avoid using spaces and inadvertently having
your input interpreted as multiple commands. For example, push a list onto
the stack:

```sh
$ rpn.py
--> [1,2,3]
```

but if you try that with embedded spaces, you'll get an error:

```sh
$ rpn.py
--> [1, 2, 3]
Could not eval('[1,'): unexpected EOF while parsing (<string>, line 1)
Could not exec('[1,'): unexpected EOF while parsing (<string>, line 1)
Did you accidentally include whitespace in a command line?
```

this can be avoided with the `:n` (no split) modifier, but note that the
modifier will only affect the _next_ (and subsequent) lines. You can just
give an empty command with the `:n` modifier to toggle to no line
splitting:

```sh
$ rpn.py
--> :n  # no splitting of subsequent lines
--> [1, 2, 3]
```

If you want `rpn.py` not to split lines into multiple commands by default,
run with the `--noSplit` command-line option. You can then use `:s` (split)
if you instead want to switch to writing input lines that should be split.
Hence:

```sh
$ rpn.py --noSplit
--> [1, 2, 3]
--> :s  # split subsequent lines
--> 4 5
```

the above will first push the list `[1, 2, 3]` onto the stack, then toggle
to line splitting, and then `4` and `5` will be split (on whitespace),
treated as two separate commands, and result in two more values being
pushed onto the stack.

#### Whitespace

Leading and trailing whitespace in the command is ignored. Whitespace
anywhere in the modifiers is ignored (unless line splitting is on, in which
case you will get errors).

#### Engineering notation

Numbers can be inputted using engineering notation:

```
$ rpn.py
--> 20k 1.5M +
1.52M
```

Values on the stack will only be displayed using engineering notation if they
were inputted so:

```
$ rpn.py
--> 2000
--> f
--> [2000]
--> 2k
--> f
--> [2000, 2k]
--> +
--> [4k]
```

## Operation via standard input

When reading from standard input, the lines will be split on whitespace and
each field is treated as a separate command. This allows for simple
command-line usage such as

```sh
$ echo 4 5 + | rpn.py
9
```

For convenience, modifiers can be preceded by whitespace:

```sh
$ echo 100 log10 :! apply | rpn.py
2.0
```

In the above, the `:!` modifier applies to the preceding `log10` function
(causing it to be pushed onto the stack).

If you have a file of commands you want to pipe into `rpn.py` you might
want to turn off this splitting:

```sh
$ cat data
4
5
# This is a comment
+

$ rpn.py < data
9
```

You can change the separator using `--separator`:

```sh
$ echo 4_5_+ | rpn.py --separator _
9
```

By default, the final calculator stack is printed when standard input is
exhausted:

```sh
$ echo 4 5 | rpn.py
[4, 5]
```

You can disable the final printing with `--noFinalPrint`:

```sh
$ echo 4 5 | rpn.py --noFinalPrint
```

in which case you can print things yourself using the `p` command (see
below).

<a id="repl"></a>
## REPL operation

In REPL mode, the calculator repeatedly prints a prompt, reads a command,
and executes it. For example:

```sh
$ rpn.py
--> 4 5 +
--> p
9
```

you can change the prompt using `--prompt` on the command line.

## Commands

There are two kinds of commands: special and normal.

### Special commands

* `apply`: Apply a function to some arguments.
* `clear` (or `c`): Clear the stack.
* `dup` (or `d`): Duplicate `count` (default 1) arguments.
* `functions`: Print a list of all known functions.
* `join`: Join stack items with a string.
* `list`: Convert the top stack item to a list by iterating it. With a count > 1
    pops that many stack items off the stack and into a list that is pushed.
* `pop`: Pop `count` (default 1) stack item.
* `print` (or `p`): Print `count` (default 1) stack item from the top of the stack.
* `quit` (or `q`): Quit
* `reverse`: Reverse the `count` (default 2) top stack items.
* `reduce`: Repeatedly apply a function to stack items (see
  [functools.reduce](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/functools.html#functools.reduce)).
* `stack` (or `s` or `f`): Print the whole stack.
* `store`: Store the value on the top of the stack into a variable (whose name has
    previously been pushed onto the stack). If given a numeric argument, that number
    of items from the stack will be stored into the variable as a list.
* `swap`: Swap the top two stack elements (this is the same as calling
    `reverse` with no arguments.
* `undo`: Undo the last stack-changing operation and variable settings.
* `variables`: Show all user-defined variables and their values.
* `variables_all`: Show **all** known variables and their values.

### Normal

Many functions from the `builtins`, `math`, and `operator` modules are
available. Often you can just type the function name (e.g., `log10` not
`math.log10`).  You can call a function with an argument if you want and
the result will be pushed onto the stack:

```sh
# This works unquoted in bash. You may need quotes in your shell (e.g, in fish).
$ rpn.py abs(-50)
50
```

or if you just name the function it will be applied to the item (or items)
on the top of the stack, using a heuristic guess at the number of arguments
the function would normally take (the number of positional or
positional-or-keyword arguments). If the guess is wrong, you can always
`undo` and run the function again with an explicit number of arguments.

```sh
# Call 'round' (which takes one argument by default) on pi.
$ rpn.py pi round
3

# Round pi to 10 decimal places. :2 tells 'round' to use two stack arguments.
$ rpn.py pi 10 round:2
3.1415926536
```

You can use the `functions` command to see a list of all known functions
and the number of arguments they'll expect on the stack (assuming you don't
pass arguments directly as with `abs(-50)` above or use a numerical
modifier (e.g., `:3`) to explicitly specify the number of arguments that
should be passed. Here's the first part of the output of `functions`:

```sh
$ rpn.py functions
!= Function(ne (calls operator.ne with 2 args))
* Function(mul (calls operator.mul with 2 args))
+ Function(add (calls operator.add with 2 args))
- Function(sub (calls operator.sub with 2 args))
/ Function(truediv (calls operator.truediv with 2 args))
== Function(eq (calls operator.eq with 2 args))
Context Function(Context (calls decimal.Context with 0 args))
Decimal Function(Decimal (calls decimal.Decimal with 1 arg))
DecimalTuple Function(DecimalTuple (calls decimal.DecimalTuple with 3 args))
abs Function(abs (calls operator.abs with 1 arg))
acos Function(acos (calls math.acos with 1 arg))
acosh Function(acosh (calls math.acosh with 1 arg))
add Function(add (calls operator.add with 2 args))
all Function(all (calls builtins.all with 1 arg))
and_ Function(and_ (calls operator.and_ with 2 args))
any Function(any (calls builtins.any with 1 arg))
ascii Function(ascii (calls builtins.ascii with 1 arg))
asin Function(asin (calls math.asin with 1 arg))
asinh Function(asinh (calls math.asinh with 1 arg))
atan Function(atan (calls math.atan with 1 arg))
atan2 Function(atan2 (calls math.atan2 with 2 args))
atanh Function(atanh (calls math.atanh with 1 arg))
attrgetter Function(attrgetter (calls operator.attrgetter with 1 arg))
# 300+ lines deleted
```

## Variables

You can set variables and push them (or their values) onto the stack:

```sh
$ rpn.py --noSplit
--> a = 4
--> a
--> f
[4]
--> a:!
--> f
[4, Variable(a, current value: 4)]
--> a = 10
--> f
[4, Variable(a, current value: 10)]
--> 20
--> +:p
30
```

## Modifiers

Modifiers for a command are introduced with a colon, `:`. The modifiers are
all single letters and may also include a single non-negative integer. When
line splitting is on, the colon and modifier letters and integer cannot
contain whitespace. I.e., `:pr34`. If line splitting is off, whitespace is
allowed (and ignored).

The full list of modifiers is:


*   `!`: Push the given thing (either a function or a variable) onto the stack,
    do not try to run or evaluate it.
*   `*`: Use all arguments from the stack in the command execution.
*   `=`: The command will be run but the stack will not be altered (think: keep
    the stack equal). This is useful in combination with the `p` modifier to
    print the result. It can be used to try an operation and see its result
    without actually doing it.  If you do execute a command and want to undo
    it, there is also the `undo` special command.
*   `c`: Force the command line string to be interpreted as a
    special command. This must be used if you define a variable with a name
    like `quit` or `pop` and you then can't call the special `quit` command.
*   `D`: Toggle debug output.
*   `i`: Iterate the result of the command and put the values onto
    the stack in a list. This is useful when you call a function that returns a
    generator or other special iterable object. It's a convenience for just
    calling the function (which would put the generator onto the stack) and
    then running `list`.
*   `n`: Turn off (think: no) line splitting. Note that this will only go into
    effect from the _next_ command on.
*   `p`: Print the result (if any). See also the `:P` modifier and the `--print`
    argument to `rpn.py`.
*   `P`: Toggle automatic printing of all command results.
*   `r`: When applied to a special command, reverses how the function (for
    `map`, `apply`, `reduce`) or a string (for `join`) is looked for on the
    stack. If `:r` is used, the function or string argument to one of those special
    functions has to be pushed onto the stack first. In other contexts, causes
    all arguments given to a function to be reversed (i.e., to use a stack order
    opposite to the normal):

        ```sh
        $ rpn.py '5 4 +:! apply'
        9
        $ rpn.py '+:! 5 4 apply:r'
        9
        $ rpn.py '5 4 -'
        1
        $ rpn.py '5 4 -:r'
        -1
        ```
    See <a href="#reversing">below</a> for more detail.
*   `s`: Turn on line splitting on whitespace. Note that this will only go into
    effect from the _next_ command on.

If a count is given, it is either interpreted as a number of times to push
something onto the stack or the number of arguments to act on, depending on
context (um, sorry about that - should be clearer).

<a id="reversing"></a>
### Reversing argument ordering

You might find it more natural to use `map` and friends the other way
around. I.e., first push the function, then push the iterable to be acted
on, and then call `map`.  In that case, you can use the `:r` modifier to
tell the calculator to reverse the order of the arguments passed to a
function. In the following, we push in the other order and then use
`map:ir` (the `i` is just to iterate the `map` result to produce a list).

```sh
$ rpn.py 'str:! [6,7,8] map:ir'
['6', '7', '8']
```

Note that if you use the `:r` modifier to when running a function (like
`map` or `apply`) that needs a callable (or a function like `join` that
needs a string) and you don't specify a count (using `:3` for example),
`rpn.py` will search the stack for a suitable item and use the first one it
finds. It doesn't really have a choice in this case because it doesn't know
how many arguments the function (once it is found) will be applied to.
This should usually work just fine. You can always use an explicit count
(like `:3`) if not.

The argument ordering just described was the default in `rpn.py` prior to
version `2.0.0`.

## Undo

The effect of commands on the stack and variables can be undone with the
`undo` command. There is currently only one level of undo.

## History

`rpn.py` makes use of Python's
[readline](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/readline.html) library to
allow familiar/comfortable command line editing. Your input history will be
saved to `~/.pycalc_history` if your version of readline has the
`append_history_file` command (present only in Python >= 3.6)?

## Todo

* Add direct access to functionality from [numpy](https://www.numpy.org/).
* Add rotate-right and rotate-left stack modifying functions?
